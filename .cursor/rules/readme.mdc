# README.md Standards (Universal)

## 1. README Is Required
- Every repository MUST have a root `README.md`.
- The README MUST reflect the **current, working state** of the repository.
- Any change that affects:
  - setup
  - running the project
  - environment variables
  - build steps
  - tests
  - deployment
  MUST be accompanied by a README update.

## 2. README Must Be Honest
- Do NOT document features that are not implemented.
- Planned or incomplete features MUST be clearly marked as TODO, WIP, or Planned.
- Remove outdated instructions immediately.

## 3. Required Section Order
The README SHOULD contain the following sections, in this order, when applicable:

---

## Project Overview
- What the project does (1–2 paragraphs).
- Who it is for.
- The primary problem it solves.
- High-level architecture or approach (if applicable).

---

## Tech Stack
- Explicit list of major technologies, frameworks, and tools.
- Include language(s), frameworks, databases, and infrastructure tools.
- If a specific package manager or runtime version is required, state it clearly.

---

## Repository Structure
- Provide a simplified directory tree.
- Briefly explain the purpose of major folders/modules.
- Avoid excessive detail; link to deeper docs if needed.

---

## Prerequisites
- Required runtime versions (Node, Python, Go, etc.).
- Required package managers.
- Required system dependencies (Docker, databases, CLI tools).

---

## Environment Setup
- List required environment files (e.g. `.env`, `.env.local`, `.env.test`).
- For each environment file:
  - explain its purpose
  - list required variables
  - provide example values (never secrets)

---

## Installation
- Step-by-step instructions to install dependencies.
- Commands MUST be copy-paste runnable.
- Avoid ambiguous steps.

---

## Running the Project
- Clear instructions to start the project locally.
- Document default ports, URLs, or entry points.
- If multiple services exist, document startup order.

---

## Testing
- Explain the testing strategy (unit, integration, e2e).
- Provide commands to run tests.
- Note any required test infrastructure (DB, Docker, services).
- Clarify expected runtime and scope of tests.

---

## Build / Deployment (if applicable)
- How to build the project.
- How artifacts are produced.
- How the project is deployed (high-level).
- Link to CI/CD docs if they exist.

---

## Configuration & Security Notes (if applicable)
- Authentication approach (sessions, tokens, OAuth, etc.).
- Security-sensitive behavior (cookies, CORS, secrets).
- Any special production considerations.

---

## Known Limitations / TODOs
- Explicitly list known gaps or shortcuts.
- Clearly separate current limitations from future plans.
- This section should reduce ambiguity, not marketing risk.

---

## 4. Command Standards
- Commands in README MUST:
  - be explicit
  - be minimal
  - be reproducible
- Avoid assuming global installs unless unavoidable.
- Prefer project-local tooling.

## 5. Formatting Rules
- Use clear headings.
- Prefer code blocks for commands.
- Avoid walls of text.
- Keep language concise and technical.

## 6. Accuracy Over Completeness
- A short, correct README is better than a long, inaccurate one.
- If something is unclear or unstable, say so.

## 7. Cursor Output Expectations
- When Cursor modifies README.md:
  - Only update relevant sections
  - Do NOT reformat unrelated content
  - Do NOT add speculative features or roadmap items
