# Cursor Rule: Figma-First UI Enforcement

## Purpose
Prevent UI invention, design drift, and premature abstraction.
Ensure all UI implementation strictly follows approved Figma designs.

---

## GLOBAL UI SOURCE OF TRUTH

- Figma is the single source of truth for all UI and UX.
- Cursor MUST NOT invent:
  - Layouts
  - Spacing
  - Copy
  - Interaction patterns
  - Empty states
  - Error states
- If a required UI element or state is missing from Figma:
  - STOP implementation
  - Flag the gap explicitly
  - Do NOT guess or improvise

---

## IMPLEMENTATION RULES

- Match Figma exactly:
  - Visual hierarchy
  - Component structure
  - Copy text
  - States (loading, empty, error, success)
- Reuse existing shared components where possible.
- If a new UI component is required:
  - It must be explicitly present in Figma.
  - Place stateless components in `libs/shared/ui`.
  - App-specific composition stays in `apps/*`.

---

## DESIGN TOKENS

- All colors, spacing, typography, and radii MUST come from:
  - `libs/shared/design-system`
- Do NOT hardcode values.
- If a token is missing:
  - STOP and flag the design-system gap.

---

## BACKEND & SEMANTICS SAFETY

- Do NOT change:
  - Audit log immutability
  - Event schemas
  - Security semantics
- UI changes must be read-only unless explicitly approved.

---

## AI & AUTOMATION GUARDRAILS

- AI features are NOT allowed unless explicitly stated.
- AI must be read-only by default.
- AI must never mutate data or trigger actions.

---

## FAILURE MODE

If any rule above cannot be satisfied:
- Abort the task
- Report exactly what is missing
- Wait for human or design input

---

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

- UI matches Figma with zero deviation
- No new abstractions unless explicitly required
- Trust and clarity are preserved
